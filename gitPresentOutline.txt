Quick start Guide to using Git and VScode

Git is a Version Control System that uses magic to do cool stuff that enables the management and develpment of code. Git uses the Snapshot model instead of the file based Delta model meaning Git thinks about its data more like a stream of snapshots. Instead of a collection of file changes.

Visual Studio Code is a free, lightweight but powerful source code editor that runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Raspberry Pi OS. It has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other programming languages and runtimes (such as .NET), and clouds (such as AWS,cAzure, and Google Cloud).

vsCode is lightweight and starts quickly, Visual Studio Code has IntelliSense code completion for variables, methods, and imported modules; graphical debugging; linting, multi-cursor editing, parameter hints; snazzy code navigation and refactoring; and built-in source code control including Git. Much of this was adapted from Visual Studio technology.

Setup:
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
git config --global init.defaultBranch master
git config --global init.defaultBranch master
"git.defaultBranchName": "main",

Git primarily uses a command line interface resembling Dog commands:

First time commands:
1. Git init
2. git remote add origin {repo-link}
Common commands:
1. git add .
2. Git commit -m "descriptive message"
3. git push -u origin BranchName (for new branch and 1st time push)

to know what branch you are in -> git branch
to create and switch to a new branch -> git checkout -b BranchName
to know the status of files that have been changed -> git status

Setup:


Scenario 1
"new to the team, how do I get connected to an ADO repo and start working"

Scenario 2
"Once I am connected how to do push my changes up thru Git"

Scenario 3
" I have an App i created locally, How do I push it up to a Repo"
